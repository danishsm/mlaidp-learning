# PyTorch Fundamentals:

- Machine learning can be used for anything from universe, provided we can turn that 'anything' into numbers and program it to find patterns.

- For complex problems, human can't find all the rules efficiently.

- Do we always need Machine Learning to Solve problems ?
    1. Not always, As said in the [Google's Machine Learning Rule # 1](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml). In simple words, if you can find all the rules to your problem, which humans can for simple problems, Machine learning is not needed.
    2. Problems where we don't have enough data.

- Where to Use ML
    1. Problems with long lists of Rules, where traditional approach fails
    2. Everchanging Environment/Scenario 
    3. Discovering insights within large dataset
